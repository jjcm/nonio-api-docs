    h2#post_creation Post Creation
    p Submitting posts on nonio is a multi-step process, depending on the type of post you are submitting.
    p For text posts, you can submit the post directly to the /post/create endpoint.
    p For link posts, you will want to submit the URL to the /post/parse-external-url endpoint to get a summary of the opengraph data for the URL, and then submit the post to the /post/create endpoint with the data you received from the /post/parse-external-url endpoint. This isn't required, but it will give you information you likely want to include in your post.
    p For image and video posts, you will need to go through the following steps in order: 
    ol
      li Upload the media to image.non.io, or video.non.io respectively. This will return a temporary name for the media after the media has encoded. You must wait for the encoding step to finish.
      li Submit to the /post/create endpoint to create the post. This will return the url for the post. 
      li Create a post to image.non.io/move or video.non.io/move with the temporary name and the url of the post. This will move the media to the correct location and associate it with the post.
